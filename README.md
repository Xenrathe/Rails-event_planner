## TableTop Tavern, an event and scheduling app for tabletop RPGs

### Primary:

TableTop Tavern helps connect players and DMs to play tabletop RPGs (Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Warhammer, Call Of Cthulhu, etc). Users can find adventures with filters based on ruleset, platform (virtual and in-person), as well as min/max level. Additionally, users can create characters that can then sign up to attend each adventure.

Please note that TableTop Tavern is a portfolio showpiece in its current form. It lacks some features and functionality (e.g. a more complete address for in-person hosting) necessary for legitimate deployment and use. Furthermore, it has not yet been modified for mobile use, though that's on my to-do list.

TableTop Tavern is active on fly.io: (https://tabletop-tavern.fly.dev/)

### Features:
* User registration, login via Devise gem
* Easy-to-use filtering system for adventure list
* Ability to create, edit, and delete adventures
* Ability to create, edit, and delete characters who can 'attend' adventures (via a AdventureAttendance through-model / join-table)
* Validation both client and server-side across all views and models
* Real-time chat-rooms for the participants of each adventure (uses Redis server for production)
* All CSS written by hand

### Future to-do list
* Adjustments for mobile view & responsiveness
* Login via username, not just email
* Add parchment background to adventure show
* Auto-mailer integration
* Clean up / organize CSS
* Adventure SHOW (as creator): reserving seats, removing characters, inviting via email.
* Omni-Auth integration

### Design Brief
This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum, expanding on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events">Private Events</a> project.
